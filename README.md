# unity_image_with_hit_detection_on_shape
With this triangle hit-detector, we can now turn off "writable" on those big collection sprites. This is a big win for App size and memory footprint. Usage: On a Button, remove the Image component. Add a ImageWithHitDetectionOnShape component. Don't forget to patch up the &lt;Missing Image> link the in the Button component again.
